## Building on Linux

### 1. Prerequisites

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhu220840/shooting-game.git
cd shooting-game
```

### 2. Dependencies

You will need `build-essential` and the development libraries for SDL2.
On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

### 3. Build Instructions

Compile the game by running the `make` command in the project's root directory:

```bash
make
```

Run the game after compiling:

```bash
./shooter_game
```

**(Optional)**: Create a distributable package by running the `package.sh` script.
This will create a `.tar.gz` archive containing the game, assets, and all required libraries:

```bash
bash package.sh
```
